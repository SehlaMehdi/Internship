1. Creating a New Branch
Open Your Terminal:
Navigate to your local repository directory.
Create and Switch to a New Branch:
Use the following command to create a new branch named feature-branch and switch to it:
git checkout -b feature-branch

2. Making Changes and Committing
Make Changes to a File:
Open a file in your repository (e.g., README.md) and make some changes.
Stage the Changes:
Add the modified file to the staging area using:
git add README.md
Commit the Changes:
Commit the changes with a descriptive message:
git commit -m "Added new feature to README"

3. Merging the Branch
Switch to the Main Branch:
First, switch back to the main branch:
git checkout main
Merge the Feature Branch:
Merge the feature-branch into the main branch:
git merge feature-branch
If there are no conflicts, Git will automatically merge the changes and create a new commit. If conflicts occur, youâ€™ll need to resolve them manually.

Resolve Conflicts (if any):

If conflicts occur, Git will mark the conflicted areas in the affected files. Open the files, look for conflict markers (<<<<<<, ======, >>>>>>), and edit the files to resolve the conflicts.
After resolving conflicts, stage the resolved files:
git add <file>
Complete the merge with a commit:
git commit -m "Resolved merge conflicts"
